# Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide by Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, Bert Bates and Kathy Sierra

These are my C++ implementations of all the exercises in Head First Design Pattern
I did them for my own learning. I hope that they will be useful to someone else.

Please let me know if you found a mistake or a bug. 

Cheers!

NOTE: stay tune for the rest of the patterns
